> Welcome to this project!
> Check out Python for everybody! An awsome book!
> You can take it as a course on Coursera, or download the free PDF. It's also on kindle for just 1 dollar.
> Personally the best book in coding I read. Chuck the writer recommends taking the C course after this one.
> He got a special way of learning. I been struggling with getting some things to stick. But with this book you get the tools, and can practice on your own, really learning what you do.

## Chuck Lidell

> Really big thanks to chuck Lidell for putting this out for free. I been loking for the C book, but I havent found it in a format similair to this one.
> Also been looking for the book C programming for everybody, to buy, but can't find it. You can find the book at www.cc4e.com. Aswell python www.py4e.com.

### Future for the project

1. I'm not done and may update this more in the future. With the last parts in the book. I will pay for the course to get all material, in Coursera or on www.py4e.com before I dive deeper into python and web.
   2. Got some experience with those tools already, but I think I will need to buy the course to really get the juice out of the last part. We will se.

### Thanks

Thanks for giving out this awsome material for free!
